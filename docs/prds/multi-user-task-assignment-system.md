**Status:** Draft
**Priority:** High

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive task management system designed specifically for Canva design teams to efficiently assign, track, and manage design-related tasks. This backend service will provide RESTful APIs for user authentication, task management, project organization, and console-based notifications, following the Python RESTful backend service structure with FastAPI 0.119.0, Pydantic 2.12.2, and SQLite database.

## Problem Statement
Design teams currently struggle with disorganized task assignment, lack of visibility into task progress, and inefficient communication about task updates. Team members often miss task assignments or updates, leading to delays and coordination issues. There's no centralized system to track who is working on what, when tasks are due, or what the current status of each task is, resulting in poor workflow coordination and reduced productivity.

## Goals and Objectives

### Primary Objectives
- Provide a centralized platform for task assignment and management
- Enable real-time task status tracking (To Do/In Progress/Done)
- Implement efficient filtering and search capabilities
- Establish clear task ownership and accountability
- Support project-based task organization

### Success Criteria
- 100% of tasks assigned through the system within first month
- 95% reduction in missed task assignments
- 50% improvement in task completion time tracking
- 90% user adoption rate within first month
- API response times under 200ms for most operations

### Key Performance Indicators
- Task assignment rate: Tasks assigned per day
- Completion time: Average time from assignment to completion
- User engagement: Daily active users
- Task visibility: Percentage of tasks with clear status
- API performance: Response time and error rates
